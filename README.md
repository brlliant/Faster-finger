**NOTE:** There is a bug in this project which causes antivirus software to mistakenly detect it as a Trojan. Please do not download this repository until the bug is fixed or an update is provided.

This is a native Android app that allows users to tap at millisecond intervals while incorporating anti-detection protection to prevent the phone from being blocked. The app features a crosshair that indicates where to perform repeated taps, with options for both single-point and multi-point tapping.

Thanks, regards.
